## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make sure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Making Changes
1. Edit files in the `src/` directory
2. Follow the existing code style and patterns
3. Test your changes in the browser at http://localhost:8080
4. Add or update tests for new functionality
5. Ensure all tests still pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Testing
The project includes a comprehensive Jest test suite with 300+ tests. Always run tests before submitting:

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:verbose  # Detailed output
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report
```

Tests cover:
- Game configuration validation
- Game state management (localStorage operations)
- Game mechanics and physics calculations
- Scene functionality and UI components
- Mobile responsiveness and touch controls

### Building
Before submitting, ensure the project builds successfully:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Code Style and Standards

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ syntax (classes, import/export, arrow functions)
- Follow existing patterns in the `src/scenes/` directory
- Use constants from `config.js` for game settings
- Add JSDoc comments for all classes and methods

### File Organization
- **Scenes**: Place in `src/scenes/` directory
- **Utilities**: Place in `src/utils/` directory
- **Effects**: Place in `src/effects/` directory
- **Tests**: Mirror the `src/` structure in `tests/` directory

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names: `GameScene`, `MenuScene`
- Use camelCase for functions and variables: `createPlayer`, `bubblesCollected`
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants: `GAME_CONFIG`, `SCENE_KEYS`

2. Update documentation if you've changed APIs or added features
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines
- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
