# Potato - Birthday Game

## Quick Start

**For immediate development:**
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm start           # Start development server (http://localhost:8080)
```

**For building/deployment:**
```bash
npm run build       # Create production build in dist/
```

## Overview
Build a small 2-phase birthday game for a friend using Phaser. Publish on GitHub Pages. Use LocalStorage to save progress.

Assets:
 - Player: a pixelated male human with big height
 - Bubble: small blue/red/green baloons
 - Obstacle: a small rock

## Phases
1. **Running & Collecting**
    - A horizontal plane moves under the player (infinite runner style).
    - Obstacles appear, player must jump over them.
    - Player collects bubbles that appear randomly. Bubbles are collected by colliding with them.
    - After catching the first bubble, a cutscene shows his belly glowing and a tetromino forming inside.
    - When 50 bubbles are collected, a dialog asks if player wants to play Tetris. On confirmation, belly glows brighter and game switches to Phase 2.
2. **Tetris**
    - Player plays Tetris inside character's belly using collected tetrominoes from Phase 1.
    - Speed increases after each cleared line (up to max speed).
    - After using 50 tetrominoes, player is returned to Phase 1 to collect more bubbles.
    - After 34 lines, show a message saying "Happy Birthday!".

## Requirements
- Built with Phaser
- Published on GitHub Pages
- Use LocalStorage for saving intermediate results (bubbles collected, phase, etc.)

## Setup and Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/horodchukanton/potato.git
   cd potato
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development Commands

| Command | Description | URL |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `npm start` | Start development server with hot reload | http://localhost:8080 |
| `npm run build` | Create production build | Creates `dist/` folder |

### Development Workflow
1. **Start development**: `npm start`
2. **Open browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:8080
3. **Make changes**: Edit files in `src/` - changes auto-reload
4. **Build for production**: `npm run build` when ready to deploy

### Deployment to GitHub Pages
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. The `dist/` folder contains the deployable files
3. Deploy `dist/` contents to GitHub Pages
4. Game will be available at: `https://horodchukanton.github.io/potato/`

### Current Status
âœ… Phaser framework integrated and working  
âœ… Basic project structure established  
âœ… Test scenes implemented (Preload, Menu, Game)  
âœ… Build system configured for GitHub Pages deployment  
ðŸš§ Game mechanics in development  
ðŸš§ Asset creation pending  

### Troubleshooting


#### Common Issues
- **Port already in use**: If port 8080 is busy, webpack will use the next available port
- **Module not found**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
- **Game doesn't load**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Development Tips for Agents
1. **Quick Start**: `cd /path/to/potato && npm install && npm start`
2. **Verify Game State**: Check browser console for Phaser initialization messages
3. **Test Features**: Use browser dev tools to monitor game object creation
4. **Build Verification**: After `npm run build`, serve `dist/index.html` to test production build

### Deployment to GitHub Pages
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Copy contents of `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages source
3. Commit and push to trigger GitHub Pages deployment
4. Game will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

**Port 8080 already in use:**
```bash
# Kill process using port 8080
npx kill-port 8080
# Or use different port
npm start -- --port 3000
```

**Build warnings about bundle size:**
- This is expected for Phaser games
- Bundle includes entire Phaser framework (~1.15MB)
- Warnings don't affect functionality

**Development server not accessible:**
- Ensure you're using http://localhost:8080 (not 127.0.0.1)
- Check firewall settings
- Try restarting the development server

### For Automated Agents/CI
```bash
# Complete setup and verification
npm ci                    # Clean install (faster for CI)
npm run build            # Verify build works
test -f dist/index.html  # Verify build output exists
```
