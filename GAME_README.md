# Runner + Mini Tetris (Balloon)

Two-phase Phaser 3 game:
- Phase 1 (Runner): Jump to catch falling tetrominoes on a scrolling ground. Collect 40 pieces.
- Phase 2 (Mini Tetris): Use those 40 pieces to fill a balloon-shaped mask on a 10x20 grid. No line clears; rotate/move and lock pieces to fill the shape. When filled, a balloon picture appears.
